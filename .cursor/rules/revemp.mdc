Phase A — Input & Parsing
A1. Upload Resume

o Parse with resume parser → extract: header, summary, experience, education, 
skills, certifications, projects, links.
o Normalize into schema (e.g., JSON Resume-like).
A2. Paste Job Description (JD)
• User: Pastes JD text or uploads JD file / job URL.

o JD parser → detect role, seniority, must-have and nice-to-have skills, 
responsibilities, location, keywords, qualifications.
A3. Quality Gates & Pre-Checks
• Show inline warnings if:
o Resume missing dates/companies/education.
o JD too short/ambiguous (<200 chars).
• User can fix or continue (with warnings).
Phase B — Matching & Shortlisting Report
B1. Alignment Analysis
• Inputs: Parsed Resume + Parsed JD.
• System computes:
o Keyword coverage (exact, stemmed, synonyms).
o Experience alignment (years, role titles, domain, tools).
o Education/certification match.
o ATS safety (layout, sectioning, fonts, tables, columns).
o Gaps (missing skills, metrics, domain terms).
B2. Scores & Labels
• Outputs:
o ATS Score (0–100) with sub-scores: Content, Structure, Keywords, Readability.

80 Medium, <60 Low).
o Keyword Coverage: e.g., 19/25 matched (list missing).
o Risk Flags: date gaps, job hopping, long paragraphs, passive wording.
o Impact Meter: % of bullets quantified; action verbs ratio.
